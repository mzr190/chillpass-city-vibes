# Chillpass City Vibes

This project contains a FastAPI backend in `backend/` and a React frontend in `frontend/` built with Vite.

## Building the frontend

Run the build command from the repository root:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The build output will be placed in the `build/` directory at the repository root.

If you prefer running commands inside the `frontend/` folder directly, you can still do so:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

## Development

Use `npm run dev` from the root to start the Vite dev server.
